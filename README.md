# World-Happiness-Report-2019
For my first ever repository, I want to share the project done for advanced visualization in R.  
To visualize the file please use the following link:

Special thanks to: Towards Data Science with their amazing articles and codes that work as basis for the bar chart. (https://towardsdatascience.com/create-animated-bar-charts-using-r-31d09e5841da)  

Note: Please bear in mind that the objective here is the display of graphs rather that the econometric rigurosity or analysis :)
